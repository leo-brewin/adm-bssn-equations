# Deriving the BSSN equations from the ADM equations

This repository provides simple Cadabra scripts that derives the (vacuum, zero-sift) BSSN equations, step by step, from the ADM equations.

## Overview

The work entailed in deriving the BSSN equations from the ADM equations is non-trivial. There are many steps and it can be a tad frustrating to do by hand. Thus it makes sense to use a suitable computer package to do the heavy lifting. One such package is [Cadabra][1]. This is a symbolic algebra system ideally suited to tensor computations in General Relativity. The core software is written in C++ while its native syntax is a subset of LaTeX for the tensor equations and Python to control the computations. Cadabra is mostly used to do abstract tensor computations (e.g., showing that the Levi-Civita connection is metric compatible) as well as component computations (e.g., computing the Riemann components for a Schwarzschild metric in isotropic coordinates).

The codes provided here show how easy it is easy use Cadabra to do the stated job -- to derive the BSSN equations from the ADM equations.

A detailed tutorial on Cadabra can be found [here][2] (yes, a shameless self promotion).

## Running the code

You can run the code (provided all dependancies are satisfied, see below) using

```sh
$ source SETUP.txt
$ make
```

If all goes well (as it should ðŸ˜Š) then a collection of the results, one pdf for each BSSN equation and the complete collection `eqtns.pdf`, can be found in the `source` directory (which can be compared against the similar pdf's in the `expected` directory).

## Cut to the chase

You may prefer to not install the Cadabra code and the associated Hybrid-LaTeX codes (really?). In which case you can view all of the output in the `expected` directory (you can also use these pdf's to check the output generated by Cadabra).

## Dependencies

You will need the Cadabra/Python/SymPy software.

### Cadabra

Cadabra is easy to compile and install. Full details can be found on the [Cadabra repository][4].

### Python/SymPy

A popular distribution of Python3 can be found at the [Anaconda website][9].

If you are not using the latest Anaconda distribution you may need to check that your version of SymPy is at least 1.7 (this is required only during the Ada code generation). You can install the latest version of SymPy in Anaconda using `conda install sympy`.

## Uninstall

Surely not? But if so, then you can do a complete uninstall by simply deleting this directory.
