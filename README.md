# Deriving the BSSN equations from the ADM equations

This repository provides simple Cadabra scripts that derives the (vacuum, zero-sift) BSSN equations, step by step, from the ADM equations.

## Overview

The work entailed in deriving the BSSN equations from the ADM equations is non-trivial. There are many steps and it can be a tad frustrating to do by hand. Thus it makes sense to use a suitable computer package to do the heavy lifting. One such package is [Cadabra][1]. This is a symbolic algebra system ideally suited to tensor computations in General Relativity. The core software is written in C++ while its native syntax is a subset of LaTeX for the tensor equations and Python to control the computations. Cadabra is mostly used to do abstract tensor computations (e.g., showing that the Levi-Civita connection is metric compatible) as well as component computations (e.g., computing the Riemann components for a Schwarzschild metric in isotropic coordinates).

The codes provided here show how easy it is easy use Cadabra to do the stated job -- to derive the BSSN equations from the ADM equations.

A detailed tutorial on Cadabra can be found [here][2] (yes, a shameless self promotion).

## Running the code

You can run the code (provided all dependancies are satisfied, see below) using

```sh
$ source SETUP.txt
$ make
```

If all goes well (as it should ðŸ˜Š) then a collection of the results, one pdf for each BSSN equation and the complete collection `eqtns.pdf`, can be found in the `source` directory (which can be compared against the similar pdf's in the `expected` directory).

## Cut to the chase

You may prefer to not install the Cadabra code and the associated Hybrid-LaTeX codes (really?). In which case you can view all of the output in the `expected` directory (you can also use these pdf's to check the output generated by Cadabra).

## Dependencies

You will need the Cadabra/Python/SymPy software.

### Cadabra

Ready to run binraries are available for many popular operating systems. These can be found on the [Cadabra binaries][8] page.

Cadabra can also be easily compiled from source. Full details can be found at the [Cadabra repository][4].

### Python/SymPy

Most of the popular operating system have Python3 already installed. You can check your version by running

```sh
$ python --version
```

If that does not report version 3 or later, then you will need to manually install python. Most operating systems provide native package managers (HomeBrew on macOs, apt/dnf/yum on Linux) that you can use to do the job. Otherwise, you can install Python3 using [Conda miniforge][6].

You will also need version 1.7 or later of sympy. That may already be part of your python environment. You can check which version you have (if any) by running

```sh
$ pip list | grep sympy
```

You can upgrade sympy to the latest version using

```sh
$ pip install --upgrade sympy
```

If you need to install sympy, then it is best to do so using a python virtual environment. This ensures that you leave the operating system's version of python intact. See the official [Python docs][9] on creating, using and managing virtual environments. Another very useful introduction to virtual environments can be found in this [primer][10].

## Uninstall

Surely not? But if so, then you can do a complete uninstall by simply deleting this directory.
